-*- Outline -*-

* General
** Name
A more distinctive name would probably be a good idea.
** Inspector modularity
Pull Inspector stuff out of Thing?
** Serialization
To save/restore playspace?
** Synchronization
Shabby (currently moot).
** JAX
JAX-style invocation support.
** JSH & "Shell" integration
JSH command interface. Maybe Steve Kemp's shell too.

* Evaluator
** Properties
Permit a Properties.load() for easy user customization?
** /var/tmp alt.
Use java.tmpdir in 1.2 (i.e. if available).
** Compiler options
(E.g. -deprecation.) Where needed.
** Redefs
Is it possible to allow class redefinitions?
[Very difficult, esp. in 1.1.]

* Main
** `* $foo', `~ $foo'
Implement `*' and `~' for specific variable.
** `: int $i=1, $j; Object $o, $p=new Boolean()'
Let `:' supply init value w/ Querier. Basically expand syntax to make it more
natural to a Java programmer.
** System shell
Generally less important as other software (e.g. JSH) fulfills this role much
better.
*** `$ cat > foo.txt' fails
Does not forward input.
*** Envvars
Does not have any useful envvars set. (Difficult to rectify portably; Java
does not pass thru any system envvars, and loading user profile may not be
helpful, especially if Bourne Shell is not their primary shell.)  Giving
--login to shell helps, but is slow. Possibly could run a login shell once
invisibly, having that run `env', and use those envvars subsequently?
*** SIGPIPE
Seems to fail to stop on Linux/Solaris of a pipe is used that breaks off,
though this works fine on Irix. No apparent solution.
** Classpath
Would be useful to be able to interactively modify the classpath.
[Easy to modify--hard to make evaluator honor it! Commented out for now.]

* Inspector
** One-line embedded expressions
Indentation could be a little better.
** `// ...'
Should be printed in case of skipped class bodies.
** Dictionary
Keep track of already-inspected objects (vs. classes)?
